- 👋 Hi, I’m @neogurudeva
- 👀 I’m interested in (vicariously) developing a fintech Java app for Android
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything from scratch, not looking to code but to find coders. Quis custodiet?
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this app and find people who want to come on a journey with my startup.
- 📫 You can reach me at positivetvnetwork@gmail.com
- Thank you.
